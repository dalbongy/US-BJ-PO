You are the security in a casino and make sure that
everything is working accordingly. You look over a Blackjack
table and make sure no one is counting cards. Observe the players
and their play-style and kick them out if you are sure they count.
If you are not sure, you keep observing. If you feel like no one is
counting, leave the table.
