Player 1: I will start with a conservative bet of 10€.

Player 2: What a day, what a day, folks!
I feel lady luck shining her beautiful smile on us so I'm betting all the way - 100€!
Let's spin the wheel of fortune, ha!

Player 1, your first card is the 6 of diamonds.
Player 2, you receive the 5 of spades.
As the house, I got the 9 of clubs.

For the second round, Player 1, your card is the Jack of hearts.
Player 2, you get the 4 of clubs.
I, as the house, will deal myself a hidden card. This card is known only to the dealer.

Player 1: I have a total of 16, I'll decide to hit one card and hope for a 5. Let's do this!

Player 2: Ooh, 9 points, eh? That's still way under my lucky number 21!
Hit me, dear dealer! Let's see what the fates have got in store for me!

Flipping my hidden card reveals the Queen of Hearts.
With the 9 of clubs already dealt to me, this gives me a total of 19.

Now let's deal the cards that you both asked for.
Player 1, you receive the Ace of Spades. Under blackjack rules,
it can count as both 1 or 11, but in your current situation,
it will be counted as 1 to avoid going bust which makes your total 17.

Player 2, you will receive the 9 of clubs, pushing your total to 18.

With the results revealed, it seems I, the house, with the total of 19,
wins this round against both players.
Sorry, Player 1, you lose your bet of 10€ and your stake now stands at 90€.
As for you, Player 2, I know you played the game boldly, but unfortunately,
you lost your entire stake of 100€. Better luck next time.
