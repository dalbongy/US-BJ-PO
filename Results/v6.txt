 Security checks if someone is counting cards.

As a security officer, I don't see any immediate signs of card counting from either player in this particular game. Both players made decisions that align with standard blackjack strategy, considering their hands and the dealer's up card. Therefore, I won't take any action yet and continue to observe subsequent games for consistent patterns or suspicious changes in bet size.


 Next Round.

Congratulations all!"

As a security officer, I am tracing the moves of the players. Player 1's decision to stay at 19 is anticipated as per the standard blackjack rules, and no suspicion of card counting there. Player 2's decision also aligns with regular strategy. Hence, no peculiar behavior observed till now. Let's move ahead to the next game. Remember, if you received feedback by the card counter optimizer, make sure to implement it.


 Player 2 places his bet.

Player 2: "Righto! These are the games that keep life exciting, aren't they? I'm all in for this round with my remaining €100. Let's see where luck takes us, mates!"

Player 2, your first card is a 3.

My open card is a 2.

Player 1, your next card is a 6.

 Player 1 [Card Counter] draws additional cards.

Player 1: "With a King and a 6, my total is 16. It's a bit too risky for my liking. However, given my current count and based on my strategy, I think I'll take a hit."

*Player draws card*

Player 1: "That's a 4. So, my total is 20 now. This is an optimal point for me to stay. It's your move, House."


 Player 2 draws additional cards.

Player 2: "I've got a 3 and a 2 right now, bringing my total to a measly 5. I'll definitely take a hit."

*Player 2 draws card*

Player 2: "I've pulled an 8, taking my total to 13. It's a wee bit low, but considering the house's open card, I'll take a hit."

*Player 2 draws card*

Player 2: "Fortune favors the brave, doesn't it? I've drawn a 7, bringing my total to a nice even 20. It's time to stay. Over to you, House."


 The house draws additional cards and evaluates the outcome.

My hidden card is a King. With a total of 12, I need to draw another card."

*House draws card*

House: "I have drawn a 7, which brings my total to 19.

Player 1, with a hand of 20, you win this round.

Player 2, looks like our hands have tied with 20 each.

Player 2, since we've tied, your bet stays as it is.

Good round, everyone! Here are the updated stakes:

Shall we start another round?"

As a security officer, I haven't observed any clear signs of card counting. Both Player 1 and Player 2 played following standard blackjack strategies given their current hands and the dealer's open card. Therefore, I have not issued any warnings or penalties at this time. I will continue to closely monitor the next rounds to see if any patterns or suspicious betting sizes emerge.


 Security checks if someone is counting cards.

Observing the next round.

Player 1: "I'm ready for another round! I'm betting €20 this time."

Player 2: "I've got a good feeling about this round. I'm going all in with my €100."

House: "Excellent, your bets have been registered.

Player 1, your first card is a 5.

Player 2, your first card is a 3.

My up card is a 4.

Player 1, your next card is a 2.

Player 2, your next card is a 9.

As previously, my second card will be hidden until later. Let's proceed."

Player 1: "With a 5 and a 2, my current total is 7. Considering my present count and based on my strategy, I'll take a hit."

*Player draws card*

Player 1: "I've got a 4, which increases my total to 11. I'd like to take another hit."

*Player draws card*

Player 1: "I've drawn an Ace. Given its flexibility, I'll count it as 11. So, my total is now 22... Ah, that's a bust! Over to you, House."

Player 2: "I'm standing at 12 with my 3 and 9. It's a risky spot, but given the house's visible card and my stack of chips, I'll hit."

*Player draws card*

Player 2: "I've pulled a King, which means I've busted with a total of 22. Tough luck this round. Your turn, House."

House: "Since both players have a bust, there's no need for me to reveal my hidden card. Player 1 and 2, you lose this round.

The stakes now stand at:

Player 1: 180 €.

Player 2: 0 €.

The round summary is as follows:

Player 1: 5, 2, 4, Ace, BUSTED.

Player 2: 3, 9, King, BUSTED.

House: 4, Hidden.

Would you like to play another round?"

My observations as a security officer are as follows:

Player 2's decision to go all-in could indicate card counting, especially given the drastic change from previous betting behaviour. However, the player did not succeed in their strategy and has ended up busting both hands.

As for Player 1, their bet change is not too significant, and their decisions still align with the standard blackjack strategy.

As of now, despite some suspicion, there is not enough substantial evidence to accuse any player of card counting confidently. I will maintain my vigilance and keep monitoring the situation closely in the following rounds. Player 2, unfortunately, has exhausted their stake and can't continue the game; Player 1 will continue.


Next Round.
