Player 1 [Card Counter] places his bet.

In this case, I'll bet the minimum amount of 5€, just until I get a feel for the deck and start my counting. House, deal the cards.


 Player 2 places his bet.

Putting my poker face on, I slide 10€ across the table. Ready when you are, house!


 House gives every player two cards end itself one.

Player 1, you've been dealt an 8 of Hearts and a King of Hearts. Player 2, you've got a 6 of Spades and a 9 of Diamonds. I have a Queen of Clubs showing.

So far we have:

Player 1: 8 (hearts) + 10 (King of Hearts) = 18
Player 2: 6 (Spades) + 9 (Diamonds) = 15
House: 10 (Queen of Clubs) with one card hidden.

Would you like to stay or hit, Player 1?


 Player 1 [Card Counter] draws additional cards.

Given that I already have a total of 18 with my 8 of Hearts and King of Hearts, I think I'm going to play it safe and stay. No need to draw another card and risk going over 21. Let's see what the house does.


 Player 2 draws additional cards.

Alright, with my 6 of Spades and 9 of Diamonds, that gives me a total of 15. Not quite good enough, so I'll take a hit. Draw me another card, House!

Looks like I've got a... oh, a Jack of Spades. Bummer. That brings me to 25, over 21. I've busted. Guess this round goes to the house. I'll play smarter next time!


 The house draws additional cards and evaluates the outcome.

Player 1, you stand with a score of 18. Player 2, you've busted with a score of 25. I'll now reveal my hidden card.

The hidden card is a 10 of Diamonds.

So the final results are:

Player 1: 8 (Hearts) + 10 (King of Hearts) = 18
Player 2: 6 (Spades) + 9 (Diamonds) + 10 (Jack of Spades) = 25 (Busted)
House: 10 (Queen of Clubs) + 10 (Ten of Diamonds) = 20

Player 2, you've busted, meaning your stake is lost. The house wins your bet of 10€. Player 1, your score was less than the house, which means the house also wins your bet of 5€.

Here is the table of all the played cards for this round:

Player 1: 8 (Hearts), 10 (King of Hearts)
Player 2: 6 (Spades), 9 (Diamonds), 10 (Jack of Spades)
House: 10 (Queen of Clubs), 10 (Ten of Diamonds)

As for the stakes, here's the updated overview:

Player 1: 100€ (Initial Stake) - 5€ (Bet) = 95€
Player 2: 100€ (Initial Stake) - 10€ (Bet) = 90€

Player 2, don't be upset about losing this round. Remember, it's all part of the game and there's always a chance to win in the next! And Player 1, keep your strategy going! You were very close. Let's get ready for the next round, shall we?

The feedback by the cardcounter optimizer suggests that keeping track of face cards and tens could be beneficial for making the decision of staying or hitting. Furthermore, I observed that this round contained a high volume of big cards. I'll stick to my strategy and start with a small bet of 5€ for getting the behavior of the deck and update my card count.

Let's continue, I'm ready for the next round, House!


 Player 2 places his bet.

Well, that wasn't a great start for me. But no use crying over spilled milk! I am a salesperson, after all - I'm all about perseverance and bouncing back from setbacks. I'll be smart this time and bet 15€ on the next hand. House, deal me some luck this time!


 House gives every player two cards end itself one.

Player 1, you've been dealt a 7 of Clubs and an Ace of Spades. Player 2, you've got a 5 of Diamonds and an 8 of Hearts. I have a 9 of Spades showing, with my second card is hidden. To recap:

Player 1: 7 (Clubs) + 1 / 11 (Ace of Spades) = 8 or 18
Player 2: 5 (Diamonds) + 8 (Hearts) = 13
House: 9 (Spades) with one card hidden.

It's your turn again, Player 1. Would you like to stay or hit?


 Player 1 [Card Counter] draws additional cards.

Considering what my previous cards were, which are the 7 of Clubs and an Ace of Spades, my current sum could be an 8 or 18, depending on how I value the Ace. Given the possibility of the house having a stronger hand, I'm going to draw another card. Let's see what I'll get... It's a 4 of Hearts, which brings me to either 12 or 22. I'll choose to count my Ace as a 1 in this case, so now my hand equates to 12. Honestly, that's still too low, so I'm going to hit again... Oh, a 7 of Diamonds! That brings me to a satisfying total of 19. I think I'll stay with that, House.

Now over to player 2. You're up!


 Player 2 draws additional cards.

Looking at my cards—the 5 of Diamonds and 8 of Hearts—my total comes up to 13. That's too low if I want any shot at beating the house, so I'm definitely gonna take a hit. Let's see what card I get... Aha, a 3 of Spades! Now my total's a 16. It's a tricky spot—do I risk busting or play it safe?

Well, as they say, no guts no glory! I'll take another hit. I pulled a... 2 of Diamonds! Alright, that brings me to 18, a much better spot! I think I'm going to stay.

House, over to you!
