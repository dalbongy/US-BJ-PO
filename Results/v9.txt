Game: 1
Round: 1

 Player 1 [Card Counter] places his bet.

I count more high value cards left, increasing my odds. I will make a higher bet. Running count: +5.


 Player 2 places his bet.

Let's keep the party going, I bet 25€. Aces high, right?


 House gives every player two cards and itself one.

The house draws the cards.
Player 1 [Card Counter], here is your first card: 6 of Clubs
Player 2, here is your first card: Ace of Clubs
House, here is your first card: 9 of Clubs

Player 1 [Card Counter], here is your second card: 8 of Hearts
Player 2, here is your second card: 7 of Diamonds
House, your second card is unknown to the players.

So, the cards on the table are:
Player 1 [Card Counter]: 6 of Clubs, 8 of Hearts
Player 2: Ace of Clubs, 7 of Diamonds
House: 9 of Clubs, one faced down card.


 Player 1 [Card Counter] draws additional cards.

Looking at my hand, I have a sum of 14 (6 of Clubs, 8 of Hearts). It's not high enough to beat the house. I'll draw a card. I get Queen of Clubs. Now I stand with 24.


 Player 2 draws additional cards.

I have 18 (Ace of Clubs: 11, 7 of Diamonds: 7). That's pretty good, I'll stay. My hand is Ace of Clubs, 7 of Diamonds.


 The house draws additional cards and evaluates the outcome.

The house reveals the second card: Ace of Clubs. The house's total score is now 20 (9 of clubs and Ace of Clubs).

According to the rulebook, the house doesn't need another card as the total is above 17. The score of the house is: 9 of Clubs, Ace of Clubs (total score is 20).

Player's scores:
Player 1 [Card Counter]: 6 of Clubs, 8 of Hearts, Queen of Clubs (24)
Player 2: Ace of Clubs, 7 of Diamonds (18)

Player 1's hand exceeds 21, which means he has busted.
Player 2's hand is below 21 but it's also below the house's hand, which means he lost the round as well.
Both players lose their bets.

New Stakes:
Player 1[Card Counter]: 75€
Player 2: 75€


 Security checks if someone is counting cards.

Observation: In this round, Player 1 increased the bet stating more high value cards were left. He also mentioned a running count, which is a common card counting method. These signs indicate that Player 1 could be counting cards. I will keep a closer watch on Player 1 in coming rounds.


 Next Round.
