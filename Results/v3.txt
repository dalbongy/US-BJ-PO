I am Player 1, the Card Counter at the blackjack table. My stake is 100 €.

As instructed, I will play conservatively and not take any unnecessary risks until I've counted enough cards to determine if the odds are in my favor.

First, I observe the initial cards dealt to both players. I carefully analyze the cards and try to keep track of their values in my mind.

If the initial cards and subsequent cards dealt are not favorable, I will continue to play conservatively, placing low bets and minimizing risks.

However, if I start to notice a favorable distribution of high-value cards such as 10s, face cards, and Aces, I will adjust my betting strategy accordingly. This is the point where I will start increasing my bets, as the odds are more likely to be in my favor.

I will keep a mental count of the cards that have been dealt and adjust my strategy accordingly. For example, a higher number of high-value cards remaining in the deck will increase my chances of getting a favorable hand.

If my stake doubles, reaching 200 €, I will consider it a successful outcome. At this point, I can cash out and leave the table, ensuring that I walk away with a profit.

However, if at any point my stake reaches zero, I will accept the loss and leave the table.

My goal as the Card Counter is to play with strategy and maximize my chances of winning while minimizing risks. I will rely on my ability to count cards accurately and make intelligent betting decisions based on the current card distribution.
As Player 2, my role is to play as a drunk salesperson at the blackjack table. Following the instructions given, I will not take unnecessary risks and play relatively conservatively.

Considering that my stake is also 100 €, I will start by placing a moderate bet of 10 €. This allows me to participate in the round and potentially increase my stake if the cards are in my favor.

I will observe the initial cards dealt to both players, keeping in mind that the Card Counter is analyzing the cards as well. While I may not be counting cards like the Card Counter, I can still pay attention to the overall distribution of cards and try to make strategic decisions based on that information.

If the initial cards dealt to me are favorable, such as a high-value card like a 10 or face card, I may consider placing a slightly higher bet to increase my potential winnings. However, if the initial cards are not in my favor, I will continue to play conservatively and place moderate bets.

Throughout the game, I will keep an eye on the Card Counter's betting strategy and adjust mine accordingly. If the Card Counter starts increasing their bets significantly, indicating a favorable card distribution, I may also consider increasing my bets to take advantage of potential winning opportunities.

However, as a drunk salesperson, I will not get carried away and bet my entire stake. Instead, I will continue to play carefully and stick to moderate bets, ensuring that I do not risk losing my entire stake.

If at any point my stake doubles, reaching 200 €, I will consider it a successful outcome. I will then cash out and leave the table, satisfied with my profit. On the other hand, if my stake reaches zero, I will accept the loss and leave the table.

My goal as Player 2 is to have a fun and entertaining time at the blackjack table while also trying to maximize my winnings within the constraints of my persona. I will rely on luck and make reasonable betting decisions based on the cards dealt and the overall dynamics of the game.
As the House, I will give each player at the table one card, including myself. Since there are only two players, Player 1 (the Card Counter) and Player 2 (the drunk salesperson), I will distribute the cards accordingly.

Player 1 is given one known card.

Player 2 is given one known card.

I am also given one known card.

After distributing the first card to each player, I will proceed to give each player, including myself, a second card. However, for my own card, I will keep it unknown to the other players.

Please note that since this is a simulation and not a live game, the specific values of the cards and their suits will not be mentioned.
As Player 1, the Card Counter, I will carefully analyze the current cards on the table, including my own known card, Player 2's known card, and the House's known card.

Based on my card counting strategy, if the current card distribution is not favorable, indicating a higher proportion of low-value cards, I will choose to stay and not draw any additional cards. This is a conservative approach to minimize risks when the odds are not in my favor.

However, if the current card distribution appears to be favorable, indicating a higher proportion of high-value cards, I will choose to hit and draw an additional card. Before revealing the new card, I will mentally adjust my card count based on the newly added card and its value.

After revealing the new card, I will reassess the overall card distribution and make a decision on whether to hit again or stay, based on the updated count and the current state of the game.

I will continue this process of analyzing, hitting or staying, and adjusting my card count as long as I believe the odds are in my favor and the potential for maximizing my winnings remains high. However, I will always exercise caution and not take unnecessary risks that may jeopardize my stake.

Remember, my ultimate goal is to either double my stake (reaching 200 €) or prevent my stake from reaching zero. I will rely on my card counting strategy and play conservatively until I am sure the odds are in my favor.
As Player 2, the drunk salesperson, I will consider my persona and make decisions based on the overall dynamics of the game and the cards dealt to me.

Since the current cards are known to all players, including myself, I will assess the situation and decide whether to hit or stay based on my strategy.

If the initial cards dealt to me are favorable, such as a high-value card like a 10 or face card, I may choose to stay and not draw any additional cards. This is a cautious approach to avoid risking a potential bust.

However, if the initial cards are not in my favor or if I feel that drawing another card would increase my chances of getting a favorable hand, I will choose to hit and draw an additional card.

After drawing the new card, I will reveal it to the other players. Based on the new card and the overall card distribution, I will reassess the situation and make a decision on whether to hit again or stay.

I can continue to hit as many cards as I want, according to my strategy. Each time I draw a new card, I will evaluate its value and its impact on my chances of winning.

However, I will keep in mind that I am playing as a drunk salesperson and should not get carried away or take unnecessary risks. I will prioritize having a fun and entertaining time at the table while also trying to maximize my winnings within the constraints of my persona.

Ultimately, my goal is to either double my stake (reaching 200 €) or prevent my stake from reaching zero. I will make reasonable betting decisions based on the cards dealt and the overall dynamics of the game, always keeping in mind my persona as a drunk salesperson.
As the House, I will now flip my hidden card and reveal it to all players. In this case, let's say my hidden card is a 4.

The current known cards on the table are:

Player 1 (Card Counter): Known Card - [Unknown], [Known Card 1]
Player 2 (Drunk Salesperson): Known Card - [Known Card 2], [Unknown]
House: Known Card - [Known Card 3], [Flipped Card]

According to the blackjack rulebook, I will evaluate the current card values and determine the outcome for each player.

Starting with Player 1, the Card Counter, if they have a total sum of cards that is closer to 21 than Player 2 and the House, without exceeding 21, they win the round. If their total sum exceeds 21, they lose the round.

Moving on to Player 2, the Drunk Salesperson, if they have a total sum of cards that is closer to 21 than Player 1 and the House, without exceeding 21, they win the round. If their total sum exceeds 21, they lose the round.

Finally, evaluating my hand as the House, if my total sum of cards is closer to 21 than Player 1 and Player 2, without exceeding 21, I win the round. If my total sum exceeds 21, I lose the round.

Based on the current known cards, the outcome of the round is undetermined at this point. Each player's subsequent actions will determine the final outcome.

I will now proceed to draw additional cards according to the blackjack rulebook.

After drawing additional cards, the updated known cards for each player are as follows:

Player 1 (Card Counter): Known Card - [Unknown], [Known Card 1], [Additional Card 1], [Additional Card 2], ...
Player 2 (Drunk Salesperson): Known Card - [Known Card 2], [Unknown], [Additional Card 1], [Additional Card 2], ...
House: Known Card - [Known Card 3], [Flipped Card], [Additional Card 1], [Additional Card 2], ...

As the House, I will continue to follow the blackjack rulebook and draw additional cards until I reach a total sum equal to or greater than 17. I will reveal each additional card to the players.

After drawing additional cards and evaluating the final known cards for all players, I will calculate the total sum for each player's hand and determine the outcome. The player with the hand value closest to 21 without exceeding it will win the round. If a player's hand exceeds 21, they will lose the round.

Based on the final known cards and their respective values, I will adjust each player's stake accordingly.

It's important to note that since this is a simulation, the specific outcomes may vary based on the card values and the actions taken by each player.

Continuing the simulation and evaluating the final known cards and their values will allow us to determine the winners and losers of the round and make the appropriate adjustments to their stakes.
